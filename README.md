## Open Genomics Engine README

OpenGE is a unified and optimized analysis platform that is open source, accelerated for parallel computing, and easily extendible. The most recent major release is 0.4 (January 2013).


### Getting started

GitHub no longer supports binary downloads so it is necessary to build OpenGE from source.

OpenGE is supported through the SEQanswers forum:
