README
GATK classes ported for OpenGE

Last updated: Lee Baker, 18 May 2012

INTRODUCTION
In order to ease porting several algorithms from GATK, we have attempted to port all or parts of several classes used. This folder contains many classes ported over from the GATK source code.

Many ports are incomplete, and may not include or support all features that the class has in GATK.

License
All GATK code is released under the license which it was obtained, which is clearly indicated at the top of each file.
