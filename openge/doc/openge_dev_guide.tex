\section {Compiling OpenGE}
Building OpenGE is tested on Ubuntu Linux and Mac OS X, and should be compatible with most other POSIX systems.

\subsection{Ubuntu}
These steps have been tested on Ubuntu 11.10, and are likely similar for other versions.

Ensure that you have the following packages installed: cmake, libboost-program-options-dev, and have these tools installed: gcc, make, git. Gcc and make are part of the build-essentials package, which you should probably install if you haven't already.

Check out the source code from github:
\cmd{git clone git@github.com:adaptivegenome/openge.git}

Open the directory containing the code you just checked out- it should be called openge. Make a folder inside the directory called 'build'. This is where cmake will put temporary build files. Generate those build files using cmake.
\cmd{cd openge\\mkdir build\\cd build\\cmake ..}

Compile the code.
\cmd{make}
The resulting binary will be in the openge/bin/ directory.

TODO- test these steps on Ubuntu.

\subsection{Mac}
These steps are tested on Mac OS X 10.7, and are likely similar for other versions.

TODO - Mac compile steps.

\subsubsection{Using XCode on Mac}
Apple's XCode can also be used to compile OpenGE. To use XCode, perform the same steps as above, up until cmake. Use the following flags instead:
\cmd{cmake -G Xcode ..}
and a project file called OpenGE.xcodeproj will be created. Open this in Xcode.

Note: there are issues when using XCode 4.3 or later with cmake- generally cmake cannot find a compiler, or has issues with the c compiler it does find. To fix this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Make sure you have installed the command line tools from within XCode's preferences (under Preferences-Downloads-Documentation).
\item Create a symlink from /Developer/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/version.plist to /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/version.plist. This helps cmake find the installed developer tools.
\item Run Cmake as described above.
\item After opening the project, set the base SDK to whatever version you have installed- usually "Latest Mac OS X"
\end{itemize}
OpenGE should now compile.

\subsection{Dependencies}
The following software packages should be on your machine before attempting to compile OpenGE:
\begin{itemize}
\item standard build tools: gcc, g++, make
\item Cmake
\item boost::program\_options. On Mac, you can compile this from source using the commands  (see \url{http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_49_0/doc/html/program_options.html})
\end{itemize}

\section {Contributing OpenGE}
Contributions of code or documentation are welcome. Contact us to learn more about how you can get involved at evolvability@vt.edu or interact with us through our github page.

\subsection {OpenGE on Github}
You can find OpenGE on Github at \url{https://github.com/adaptivegenome/openge}. This is where you should post issues that you have with OpenGE, and submit a pull request for any code that you may want to contribute.
\subsection {Adding a command}
Commands are represented inside OpenGE as a subclass of OpenGECommand. You should do the following things:
\begin{itemize}
\item Create a class definition for your command inside openge/src/commands/commands.h, similar to the definitions already in place.
\item Create a cpp file in the openge/src/commands/ directory that contains the implementation of your subclass. Your implementation will have two functions included- 
\cmd {void CountCommand::getOptions()}
is where you should provide definitions of your command line options, and 
\cmd{int CountCommand::runCommand()}
which is called after all command line options are parsed, and should contain the code to actually run your command. Look at the 'stats' command in command\_stats.cpp for a good example of what this class should look like.
\item Create a reference to your class in CommandMarshall::commandWithName in openge/src/commands/commands.cpp so that your command can be called from the command line.
\end{itemize}

Most commands are constructed of several modules, such as FileReader, Count, ReadSorter, that perform some action on a stream of commands. This allows us to write a new command quickly, reusing much of the common code for common tasks. Modules are in the openge/src/modules directory, and are all subclasses of AlgorithmModule.

If you are adding an algorithm to OpenGE, it is strongly recommended that you implement your algorithm as a subclass of AlgorithmModule. There are a handful of modules included with OpenGE that you can look at as examples.
