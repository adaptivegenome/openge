Open Genomics Engine

1. Introduction
See http://www.opengenomicsengine.org for more details about this project.

2. Build instructions

Building OpenGE depends on a few external packages:
boost_programoptions
zlib
pthreads
cmake

Once these are installed your system, you may compile OpenGE by dong the following:

* Inside the top level OpenGE folder, create a directory to build the source files in, and open that directory:
mkdir build
cd build

* Run cmake to generate makefiles for the projects:
cmake ..

* Compile bamtools and openge
make

Binaries will be created in the bin/ directory. On systems with  multiple processors, building multiple files in parallel may greatly reduce build times. Use the -j parameter for make- e.g. "make -j 16".
